* prove that notification and transaction order doesn't matter, i.e.
    N1 -> P1 -> N2 -> P2 == N1 -> N2 -> P1 -> P2
* optimize data structures
* merge queries
  * i.e. merge limits / offsets
* cache requests inside a transaction i.e. turn
    insert k v
    v <- quert k
  into only one insert when the transaction is commited (is this actually right?)
* from https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/transaction-iso.html
  * Declare transactions as READ ONLY when possible.
  * Control the number of active connections, using a connection pool if needed.
* notify doesn't work inside two-phase commit
* for two phase commit: clean up uncommited transactions on crash
